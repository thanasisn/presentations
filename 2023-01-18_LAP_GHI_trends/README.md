The presentation is build with `R` and `Quarto`.

The main format is `html`, and probably needs all the folders to display correctly.

Any other format (pdf, pptx) will not rendered correctly, because we use a lot of html option that, do not correspond to `beamer` or `latex`.

Most of the data and figures are prepared outside of this folder.
