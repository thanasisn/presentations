  abstract     = {Clouds significantly attenuate ground-level solar irradiance causing substantial reduction in photovoltaic power output capacity. However, partly cloudy skies may lead to temporary enhancement of local Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) above the clear-sky ceiling and, at times, the extraterrestrial irradiance. Such enhancements are referred to here as Cloud Enhancement Events (CEEs). In this work we study these CEEs and assess quantitatively the occurrence of resulting coherent Ramp Rates (RRs). We analyze a full year of ground irradiance data recorded at the University of California, Merced, as well as nearly five months of irradiance data recorded at the University of California, San Diego, and Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Our analysis shows that approximately 4% of all the data points qualify as potential CEEs, which corresponds to nearly 3.5 full-days of such events per year if considered sequentially. The surplus irradiance enhancements range from 18 W m-2 day-1 to 73 W m-2 day-1. The maximum recorded GHI of ∼1400 W m-2 occurred in San Diego on May 25, 2012, which was nearly 43% higher than the modeled clear-sky ceiling. Wavelet decomposition coupled with fluctuation power index analysis shed light on the time-scales on which cloud induced variability and CEEs operate. Results suggest that while cloud-fields tend to induce variability most strongly at the 30 min time-scale, they have the potential to cause CEEs that induce variability on time-scales of several minutes. This analysis clearly demonstrates that CEEs are an indicator for periods of high variability and therefore provide useful information for solar forecasting and integration.},

  abstract     = {Using many years of high-quality measurements from a variety of radiometers at both 1-min and 1-s resolution, this study provides a detailed analysis of cloud enhancement (CE) and albedo enhancement (AE) effects on solar irradiance. This first part focuses on global horizontal irradiance. Various possible definitions of the CE phenomenon are extracted from the literature and discussed, in the context of PV applications most importantly. Based on 10 years of 1-min measurements of all shortwave irradiance components at a high-elevation site (1829 m) on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, a frequency analysis of extreme events triggered by enhancement effects is carried out, using three different criteria to delineate enhancement effects: global horizontal irradiance (GHI) above 1 sun, and clearness index (KT) above either 0.8 or 1.0. This analysis shows that the annual frequency of these extreme events is extremely variable, and also largely dependent on the type of instrumentation (thermopile vs. photodiode). Although the scattering of light off cumulus-type cloud edges is directly associated with CE effects, three different types of CE phenomenon are proposed, which depend on the relative mix of diffuse and direct irradiance prior and during an episode, and on the magnitude of the regional albedo. The maximum observed global irradiance varies between 1546 and 1891 W m−2 at this site, depending on type of instrument and temporal resolution. The latter value (≈1.9 suns), obtained with a photodiode sensor at 1-s resolution, corresponds to KT = 1.62 and appears to constitute a new GHI world record. It results from the combination of CE and AE effects, the latter being caused by strong backscattering, itself triggered by a fresh snow cover over the region. If the magnitude and frequency of enhancement events are critical to detect rapid transients that can be harmful to PV installations, it is suggested to rely on photodiode sensors at 1-s resolution or better.},

  abstract     = {Cloudiness is the dominant factor that affects the transfer of solar irradiance through the atmosphere. Especially the type of clouds, their high spatial and temporal variability, velocity and position relatively to the Sun, could cause events ranging from total reduction to substantial enhancements of surface solar irradiance. In study, the enhancements of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at South Greece for 2 years are examined. We use 1–min averages of GHI, sunshine duration and synchronized estimations of cloud coverage and type from a digital imaging system. A radiative transfer model is used to estimate GHI under clear skies. For solar zenith angles lower than 80°, 4% of total GHI measurements are considered as enhancements. It is shown that the effect of thick clouds on the GHI enhancements is significantly higher when compared to the thin ones. We also examine cases that correspond to instantaneous clearness index values higher than 1 (Kt > 1): 228 extreme enhancement events are found including 5 cases with GHI values higher than 1367 W/m2 and a maximum value of 1420 W/m2. These results suggest that such events are common and should be included in the design and simulation of the performance of solar energy systems.},

These enhancements are derived by comparing weighted UV irradiance measurements with corresponding model calculations at each site for clear skies. We find that the frequency, magnitude, and wavelength-dependence of cloud enhancements are insufficient to explain the repeatedly high values of UVB and UVI observed by Cabrol et al., 2014, and that ozone amounts lower than have ever been seen there would be required.},
