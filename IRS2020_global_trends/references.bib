  abstract = {We present an automated algorithm for testing surface broadband radiation measurements to detect erroneous data. The methodology has been developed using data from the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Meas- urement (ARM) Program. The testing includes physically possible limits as determined by the World Meteorological Or- ganization (WMO) Baseline Surface Radiation Network, as well as user configurable limits based on climatological analysis of data collected at the measurement site. The algorithm can be run in near real time, or more typically on a daily basis. Additionally, longer monthly or yearly runs can be used to assess more subtle tendencies and problems in the data through evaluation of daily summaries of quality flagging.},

  abstract    = {This document describes the QCRad methodology, which uses climatological analyses of the surface
radiation measurements to define reasonable limits for testing the data for unusual data values. The main
assumption is that the majority of the climatological data are “good” data, which for field sites operated
with care such as those of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is a reasonable
assumption. Data that fall outside the normal range of occurrences are labeled either “indeterminate”
(meaning that the measurements are possible, but rarely occurring, and thus the values cannot be
identified as good) or “bad” depending on how far outside the normal range the particular data reside.
The methodology not only sets fairly standard maximum and minimum value limits, but also compares
what we have learned about the behavior of these instruments in the field to other value-added products
(VAPs), such as the Diffuse infrared (IR) Loss Correction VAP (Younkin and Long 2004) and the Best
Estimate Flux VAP (Shi and Long 2002).

  abstract  = {We present an automated method to identify periods of clear skies for a 160° field of view using only 1-min measurements of surface downwelling total and diffuse shortwave irradiance. The clear-sky detection method is verified using Whole Sky Imager and lidar data, observer reports, and model comparisons. Identified clear-sky irradiance measurements are then used to empirically fit clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. These fitted functions produce continuous estimates of clear-sky total, diffuse, and direct component shortwave irradiances. While this method ignores diurnal changes in such variables as column water vapor and aerosol amounts and changes between clear-sky days, it is shown that the resultant clear-sky irradiance estimates have RMS uncertainty comparable to the uncertainty of the measuring instruments themselves. The estimated clear-sky irradiances are used to estimate the effect of clouds on the downwelling shortwave irradiance as a difference between the measured and clear-sky amounts. We show that the cloud effect calculations from this method appear to decrease the uncertainty due to systematic pyranometer offsets and cosine response errors. Thus any data set that includes downwelling diffuse and total shortwave measurements can be processed to identify clear-sky periods and produce estimates of clear-sky irradiance and cloud effects.},

Other available methods to identify these periods do so by identifying periods with clear sky conditions using additional measurements, such as direct or diffuse irradiance. Our algorithm compares characteristics of the time series of measured GHI with the output of a clear sky model without requiring additional measurements. We validate our algorithm using data from several locations by comparing our results with those obtained from a clear sky detection algorithm, and with satellite and ground-based sky imagery.},

  abstract  = {Cloudiness is the dominant factor that affects the transfer of solar irradiance through the atmosphere. Especially the type of clouds, their high spatial and temporal variability, velocity and position relatively to the Sun, could cause events ranging from total reduction to substantial enhancements of surface solar irradiance. In study, the enhancements of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at South Greece for 2 years are examined. We use 1–min averages of GHI, sunshine duration and synchronized estimations of cloud coverage and type from a digital imaging system. A radiative transfer model is used to estimate GHI under clear skies. For solar zenith angles lower than 80°, 4% of total GHI measurements are considered as enhancements. It is shown that the effect of thick clouds on the GHI enhancements is significantly higher when compared to the thin ones. We also examine cases that correspond to instantaneous clearness index values higher than 1 (Kt > 1): 228 extreme enhancement events are found including 5 cases with GHI values higher than 1367 W/m2 and a maximum value of 1420 W/m2. These results suggest that such events are common and should be included in the design and simulation of the performance of solar energy systems.},

  abstract = {The variability of shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) received at Earth's surface over Thessaloniki, Greece for the period 1993-2011 is investigated, focusing on the effects from the aerosols variability on the irradiance trends derived for different solar zenith angles (SZA). Linear trends have been calculated for the entire dataset, for cloud-free cases, and for different SZAs, separately for each season. The global upward trend in SDR after 1990 (0.33{\%}year-1) is reconfirmed and is found to depend strongly on SZA, ranging from ∼0.1 to +0.6{\%}year-1. The long term changes in aerosols in conjunction with the local aerosol patterns result in differences of up to 0.1{\%}year-1 in the derived trends in SDR between morning and afternoon hours. Finally, based on the analysis of the cumulative sums of the differences in monthly averages of SDR from the long term mean we report signs of a slowdown in the upward trend in SDR during the beginning of the 2000s. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},
